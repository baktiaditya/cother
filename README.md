# Cother
A real-time collaborative code editor and previewer.  
This project is just for fun and to learn [firepad](https://github.com/firebase/firepad) implementation.

### Demo

## Development

First, install all NPM dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

It will generate an `out` directory, which can be served by any static hosting service or CDN.
